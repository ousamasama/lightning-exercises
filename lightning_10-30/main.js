1) Make an array from the one below called fave_demo that contains only ages from 18 - 49
`let ages = [12, 23, 89, 16, 34, 19, 2, 7, 45, 50, 26, 102]`

2) Choose a loop method of your choice to get this result from this array:
`let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, "5", 6, "7"]`
expected result:
`[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]`


3) Capitalize 'the', insert a comma after 'teacher' and output "Yoda says, "The greatest teacher, failure is"

`let yoda_quote = ["the", "greatest", "teacher", "failure", "is"]`

4)  * Sort the following numbers in descending order
   * Remove any integers greater than 19.
   * Multiply each remaining number by 1.5 and then substract 1.
   * Then output (either in the DOM or the console) the sum of all the resulting numbers.
